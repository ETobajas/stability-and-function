# Extended Abstract

We have experimental and observational evidence that biodiversity enhance ecosistem functioning (e.g. reviews by Cardinale et al. at Nature/Science), but the role of biodiversity for the stability of ecosistem functioning is less explored (but see X, Y), specially for functions involving several trophic levels such as plant pollination (Winfree, Garibaldi,...). Community temporal stability (estimated as the inverse of the coefficient of variation) is a property of ecological systems that results from the combination of different drivers such as species biodiversity, but also species synchrony. While community temporal stability should be related to the stability of ecosystem functions and services, there is limited evidence linking both processes on multitrophic systems. 
Several metrics have been proposed to investigate the mechanisms driving the stability being the synchrony and the species richness two metrics that have received high attention in literature. It has been observed that lower levels of synchrony in species fluctuations stabilize the community, and that higher species richness is associated with greater community stability.[esto ahora podria cortarse por redundante con lo que he añadido antes, pero esta guay]()
A key ecosistem function is plant reproductive success. Since the reproductive success of 87% plant species depends at least to some extent on pollination by animals (ollerton...), the stability of the pollinator communities may increase the plant reproductive success. [knowledge gap. Que es más importante, la complementariedad entre polinizadores? o la estabilidad del polinizador principal?]
In a recent study (Hünicken et al., 2021) have observed how the fruit set stability? in two different crops can be affected by the stability of the visitation rate of pollinators. [knoledge gap: que pasa a nivel de comunidad? cuando escalamos a la funcion de muchas plantas? Eso no lo sabemos] Similarly, Klein (2009) showed that the variation in bee species richness decreased the mean fruit set in coffee crops. [Aqui mezclas mean con stability... si la mean es importante para ti, dale un parrafo a parte y introduce primero mean y luego etsbaility]
In the current study, we investigate whether the plant reproductive success is affected by the stability of the plant and pollinator communities. In doing so, we analysed the relationship between fruit set and the seed set of X wild plants in 16 plots and the stability of plant communities (estimated as the inverse of the variation coefficient of flower production)[esta parte no las has introduciodo, o lo hacemos, o no le damos peso aquí] and pollinator communities (estimated as the inverse of the variation coefficient of visitation frequency) throughout four years, and in addition, we evaluated whether the synchrony and the species richness of the plant community and the pollinator community affect directly or indirectly, through of the stability, to the fruit set and seed set. [esto necesita mejor ingles, pero se entiende]
We hypothesized that a more stable pollinator community with higher species richness and lower synchrony will increase the reproductive success of the plants. We could also expect that the most important determinant of stability will be the direct negative effect of synchrony and that the species richness will directly promote the reproductive success of plants.
